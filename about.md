# <span class="wave">ðŸ‘‹</span> About me

Hi there, I'm Daniel, a data scientist based in Singapore.

I am currently working @[Apple](https://www.apple.com/careers/us/) where I focus on experimentation for Apple Media Products. Previously, I worked @[OCBC AI Labs](https://www.ocbc.com/group/careers/) on AI applications for banking use case and @[TripAdvisor](https://careers.tripadvisor.com/) where I focused on the optimisation of the metasearch auction.

In my spare time, I enjoy teaching and have taught the *Introduction to Data Science* course at @[General Assembly](https://generalassemb.ly/) and @[Vertical Institute](https://verticalinstitute.com/).
