<h1>Artificial Intelligence for Robotics (AI4R)<a class="headerlink" href="#artificial-intelligence-for-robotics-ai4r" title="Permalink to this headline">¬∂</a></h1>
<p>This is my course review of my 1st course in OMSCS - <a class="reference external" href="https://omscs.gatech.edu/cs-7638-artificial-intelligence-robotics">Artificial Intelligence for Robotics (AI4R)</a>. Overall, I enjoyed this course and would recommend it. The course is often suggested as one of the starting courses for students who just begun their OMSCS journey, and I largely agree.</p>
<p>If you‚Äôre curious, a course with practically the same content is available for anyone to try at <a class="reference external" href="https://www.udacity.com/course/artificial-intelligence-for-robotics--cs373">Udacity</a>.</p>

<p class="admonition-title">Why I joined OMSCS</p>
<p>If you‚Äôre curious about why I started the OMSCS programme, you can read my thoughts before I started the programme <a class="reference internal" href="../why_omscs/"><span class="doc std std-doc">here</span></a>.</p>

<section id="what-i-loved">
<h2>üëç What I loved<a class="headerlink" href="#what-i-loved" title="Permalink to this headline">¬∂</a></h2>
<p>The field of robotics captures the imagination
: The course is introduced by video that covers Professor Thrun‚Äôs experiences building autonomous vehicles and winning self-driving car competitions. Throughout the course, our assignments covered themes like laser aiming and space travel. It is incredibly powerful to structure learning over a powerful medium, and the just the Robotics/Sci-fi context helped to make the course interesting. That said, the course is still an introductory one, so I don‚Äôt expect anyone to create their self-driving car just yet.</p>
<div class="note admonition">
<p class="admonition-title">Mars 2020 Perserevance</p>
<p>In an incredible stroke of luck, the <a class="reference external" href="https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/">NASA Mars 2020 Perserevance Rover landing</a> was ongoing while I was taking this course! It sparked a lot of discussion on our class forums and it was wonderful to feel the relevance of the material we were studying.</p>
</div>
<p>A wonderful and practical application of Bayesian Inference
: Bayesian statistics is a fascinating approach to quantifying and updating uncertainty using data. I‚Äôve always been interested in this school and I was very pleasantly surprised to see Bayesian Inference in action as we learnt about Localisation. One of the starting techniques you will learn explains how a Robot can localise itself by treating its belief of its current location as a probability function, that can be constantly updated with a stream of observational data.</p>
<p>Appropriate starting course for the OMSCS programme
: It‚Äôs been a while since I went back to school and I felt that this course was at a perfect level of difficulty and challenge, to help ease me back into the groove of studying material I am seeing for the first time and finding ways to apply it to assignments. I believe that the base prerequisite to take this course is an understanding of Object-Oriented Programming. Familiarity with Python and Linear Algebra would be great pluses, but don‚Äôt worry if you don‚Äôt have that. Many of my fellow students picked it up along the way and did just fine.</p>

<section id="what-i-think-can-be-improved">
<h2>üëé What I think can be improved<a class="headerlink" href="#what-i-think-can-be-improved" title="Permalink to this headline">¬∂</a></h2>
<p>Some Assignments are incongruent with the Lecture material
: This is my biggest criticism of the course. There are some assignments that were both relevant to the lecture material and challenging. For example, if the lecture explained how a pathing algorithm worked in a 1-dimensional world, being challenged to update that algorithm to work in a 2-dimensional world is perfect. However, I felt a number of assignments had a very weak relationship with the lecture material, and instead challenged you to find the perfect balance of hyper-parameter tuning to score well. Even after I succeeded in scoring well for those assignments, I couldn‚Äôt help but feel I didn‚Äôt do much learning.</p>
<p>Professor Thrun is the course creator but not part of the team (Prof/TAs) that deliver the course
: Professor Jay Summet and his team of TAs were the actual ones who delivered the course. What that means is that while many of the course lectures are recorded by Professor Thrun, the ones who interacted with the students via the forum and graded your assignments were different. Prof. Jay and his TA team were incredible, and I have no complaints with them whatsover, but the incongruence between the lectures and course delivery did feel a little odd. At times, it did feel that the lectures were not completely in-sync with the rest of the course.</p>
<p>Code samples in the lectures need updating
: Probably, the least bothersome item, but it‚Äôs surprising that the lectures are still showing code samples using Python 2 code. I also found the code quality lower than what I would expect from a rather famous course. Things like meaningful variable names, unneccesary nested for loops and less print debugging feel like fixes that the education team could refactor once a year and drastically improve the code readability and usage.</p>

<h2>Conclusion<a class="headerlink" href="#conclusion" title="Permalink to this headline">¬∂</a></h2>
<p>Overall, the pros outweigh the cons for me. AI4R was a fantastic introduction to the world of robotics and the start of my OMSCS journey. I hope this review was useful for you and that you might consider taking this course too!</p>
