# Knowledge Based AI (KBAI)
This is my course review of my 2nd course in OMSCS - [Knowledge Based Artificial Intelligence (AI)](https://omscs.gatech.edu/cs-7637-knowledge-based-artificial-intelligence-cognitive-systems), a course focusing on building AI agents with human-like intelligence.

## üëç What I loved

Introspective course content
: The main focus of the course covers techniques to a build an Artificial Intelligence agent that can solve a variety of problems. These techniques originate from these reasoning frameworks:
- Analogical Reasoning: Transfer knowledge from known solutions to new problems
- Visuospatial Reasoning: Solving problems with visual(what) and spatial(where) data
- Common-Sense Reasoning: Solving problems through the use of Frames

I found the most rewarding part of this process is to reflect on how similar or dissimilar these techniques mirror our own human cognition.

A challenging and relevant central project
: This course has a really interesting central project where we try to build an AI agent that can answer [Raven's Progressive Matrices (RPM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raven%27s_Progressive_Matrices) problems. RPM problems are widely-used intelligence tests that uniquely, do not have a dependency on your language proficiency.

Going through the course, as we learn new techniques each week, we can iteratively apply these techniques and see our RPM-solving AI agent get better at solving the problems! I felt this project was such a great way to reinforce what we were learning each week, and genuinely had fun experimenting with different strategies.

A focus on communicating results and thinking
: Every week, you are expected to document your thinking process as you make improvements to your AI agent. After submitting our reports, we'll be assigned a number of reports from other students to peer review. This constant cycle of focusing not just in the implementation of my code, but also the communication of the thinking behind it, followed by reading others implementing and communicating their thought process, gave me a true sense of collaboration with my classmates. Every week, we were learning from each other, and improving our communication skills.

## üëé What I think can be improved

Nothing! I truly can't think of anything that needed improvment. While no course is perfect, but so far, I'd say this one comes really close.


## Conclusion
Overall, I found this course absolutely fantastic! The course material was engaging, assignments were relevant to the lessons, projects were challenging and interaction and discussions between students and teaching staff were vibrant. I thoroughly recommend anyone to take this course, and I consider it a real eye-opener as to how an online, distributed class should be ran. üëèüëèüëè
