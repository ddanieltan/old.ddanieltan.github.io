# Why I Chose OMSCS (A Data Scientist's perspective)
I started my first semester of Georgia Tech's Online Masters of Science in Computer Science ([OMSCS](https://omscs.gatech.edu/)) this year. In this blog, I share more about why I chose this programme and what are the steps you need to take if you are also thinking of applying.

```{admonition} Caveat
:class: important
This blog captures my thoughts on the OMSCS programme prior to starting the programme. At the time of writing, I am only midway through my 1st semester.

## Building new skills - My primary reason for taking a Masters
[Cal NewPort's So Good They Can't Ignore You](https://www.calnewport.com/books/so-good/) is a book I read in my youth, which shaped my thoughts on my career. The central tenet of the book is that **skills**, and not passion or certification, are truly how an individual can contribute value to any business. This focus on building skills is also fun and I believe it gives individuals continued motivation as we are not just going from job to job, we are building a *lifetime of skills*.

It was with that in mind, sometime in 2019, that I took stock of the skillsets I had acquired after working for 3 years as a Data Scientist. I was in an extremely priviledged position because I found business use cases that meshed well with my personal interest topics. Topics such as Experimentation, Time Series Analysis, Operations Research-type Optimizations were topics I would already be reading up in my spare time. So, to actually be paid in my day job to learn about these topics was such a dream come true. 

However, as much as curiousity-driven learning was fun and fulfilling for me, it is also more prone to over-specializing in niches. And, given that there are so many topics one can learn under the umbrella of Data Science, without a more structured programme, I knew I would over focus on the topics that interest me aka. never leave my comfort zone.

```{admonition} Side-note

Even though it's almost 10 years since HBR's iconic article on Data Science as the sexiest job of the 21st century [link](https://hbr.org/2012/10/data-scientist-the-sexiest-job-of-the-21st-century), the landscape for what skills a Data Scientist should have is ever expanding and not universally agreed upon. 

The more I work in Data Science, the more I realize how varied and diverse **Data Science Skills** can be.
```

So, in an effort to keep myself honest in building a lifetime of skills, I decided to embark on a Master's programme in Computer Science.

## üëç Best qualities of OMSCS 
I considered a variety of online and in-person courses, but very quickly, I settled on Georgia Tech's offering. Here's why.

### OMSCS is growing and positively reviewed
Georgia Tech 1st offered the OMSCS in 2014 to a couple of hundred students and in a couple of years since, the programme recently crossed a milestone of 10,000+ enrollments [link](https://omscs.gatech.edu/prospective-students/numbers)! I generally believe in the [wisdom of the crowds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wisdom_of_Crowds), and the growing number of people who were eager to get into this programme was a good signal for me that many others were gaining valuable skills from the programme (my primary goal).

### OMSCS is value for your money
Compared to many other online Masters programme, you get the best bang for your buck with OMSCS. To complete the OMSCS, you have to take 10 courses. Each course costs around USD500, each semester costs USD300 and you can take a maximum of 2 courses per semester. This works out to be about USD6600 if you take 2 courses a semester, to about USD8000 if you take 1 courses a semester.

Full details can be found on the [official site](https://www.bursar.gatech.edu/tuition-fees). 

### OMSCS was designed for online learning
OMSCS is often brought up as one of the key examples of how where future of higher education is headed. This was planned even before the worldwide COVID pandemic forced many of us to consider distance learning. This design encompasses the tools and process to disseminate content, proctor exams, foster interaction between students and teaching staff, which in an online format, will be rather different from the experience of an in-person programme. While I do not expect the experience of taking an online masters be  

## üëé Things to be aware of
To balance this evaluation, I also cover some of the cons and costs in taking OMSCS.

### OMSCS will require an investment/sacrifice of personal time
Make no mistake that this is a graduate level course from a top Computer Science school, and therefore, the programme is not a walk in the park. The feedback I received from others who have taken this course is unanimous in that the OMSCS will pretty much eat into a large chunk of your personal hours. 

### OMSCS offers a smaller selection of courses for online vs in-person
If you were taking the in-person programme, you would have a wider variety of courses and specializations to choose from. Although taking into context that I am a curiosity-driven learner, I know I'll be able to explore niche topics on my own if they interest me. Additionally, when looking through the courses OMSCS do provide [link](https://omscs.gatech.edu/current-courses), I feel there is an adequate coverage of key topics/courses you would expect from a Computer Science masters.

## Conclusion
Overall, I am pretty excited about this programme. I hope I will continue to feel this way as the OMSCS is going to be a fixture in my life for the next 2-3 years üòÇ. As of right now, I would say it feels great to have a new topic to learn and new skills to build every week. 


## Online Resources
OMSCS's subreddit [/r/OMSCS](https://www.reddit.com/r/OMSCS/) is a great forum to ask any OMSCS-related question. The subreddit is frequented by current and former students.

[OMS Central](https://omscentral.com/) is a review site for every course within the OMSCS to give you a sense of the level of difficulty and time commitment required.
